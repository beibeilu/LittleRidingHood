# LittleRidingHood

A story telling game.

Storytelling and retelling produce variations of the thousand-year-old folklore, the little riding hood. As social value changes, the story has been taking on new meanings and passing down different values. Surprisingly, everyone knows the story, but is unable to retell the story with the same plot or characters. This project is meant to discover how that story is told in this generation.
