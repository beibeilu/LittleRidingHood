# LittleRidingHood

##### A story telling game.

Storytelling and retelling produce variations of the thousand-year-old folklore, the little riding hood. As social value changes, the story has been taking on new meanings and passing down different values. Surprisingly, everyone knows the story, but is unable to retell the story with the same plot or characters. 

This project is meant to discover how this story is told in this generation.

Beyond this point, all is possible and still under construction. :)
